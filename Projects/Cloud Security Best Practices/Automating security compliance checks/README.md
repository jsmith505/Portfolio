# Automating Security Compliance Checks

## Overview

Security compliance is critical for ensuring that your AWS infrastructure adheres to industry standards, regulations, and best practices. Automating security compliance checks allows you to continuously monitor your environment, ensuring it remains secure and compliant with frameworks such as CIS, SOC 2, PCI-DSS, and GDPR.

This guide walks you through the steps to automate security compliance checks using AWS services and other third-party tools, ensuring that your AWS resources are always aligned with security standards.

## Features

- **Automated Compliance Audits**: Use AWS Config, AWS Security Hub, and other services to automatically audit your resources.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Receive real-time notifications of non-compliant resources.
- **Automated Remediation**: Automatically remediate non-compliant resources using AWS Systems Manager or Lambda functions.
- **Compliance Reporting**: Generate detailed reports on the compliance status of your AWS environment.

## Prerequisites

- Access to an AWS account with administrative privileges.
- Basic knowledge of AWS services such as AWS Config, AWS Security Hub, AWS Lambda, and AWS CloudWatch.
- Familiarity with security compliance frameworks (e.g., CIS, SOC 2, PCI-DSS).

## Step 1: Define Your Security Compliance Requirements

Before automating compliance checks, define the compliance standards your environment must meet. These might include industry-specific standards like **PCI-DSS** for payment card data or **CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark** for AWS-specific security guidelines.

### Example Compliance Standards:
- **CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark**
- **SOC 2**
- **PCI-DSS**
- **GDPR**
- **ISO/IEC 27001**

## Step 2: Enable AWS Config for Continuous Monitoring

**AWS Config** is a service that enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources. It continuously monitors your environment and records configuration changes.

1. Navigate to the **AWS Config Console**.
2. Choose **Get started** or **Set up AWS Config**.
3. Select the resources you want to track (e.g., EC2 instances, IAM roles, VPCs).
4. Choose the storage location for your configuration history (S3 bucket).
5. Enable **AWS Config Rules** to check for compliance automatically.
6. Select compliance rules based on your standards (e.g., CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark).

AWS Config will now continuously evaluate your resources for compliance.

## Step 3: Integrate AWS Security Hub for Security Standards

**AWS Security Hub** centralizes security findings from various AWS services and provides a comprehensive view of your security and compliance posture. It allows you to automate compliance checks and gain visibility into your environment.

1. Navigate to the **AWS Security Hub Console**.
2. Enable **Security Hub** and select the region you want to monitor.
3. Choose the **Standards** to enable, such as:
   - **CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark**
   - **PCI-DSS**
   - **AWS Foundational Security Best Practices**
   - **SOC 2** (via third-party integrations)
4. Review the findings and set up **Automated Remediation** for non-compliant resources (optional).

### Example Findings:
- Unrestricted inbound traffic to EC2 instances.
- IAM roles with overly permissive policies.
- S3 buckets with public read/write access.

## Step 4: Automate Remediation with AWS Lambda

For resources that are non-compliant, you can automate remediation using **AWS Lambda** functions. For example, you can create a Lambda function that automatically disables S3 buckets with public access.

1. In the **AWS Lambda Console**, create a new function.
2. Write a function to remediate the non-compliant resource (e.g., turn off public access on S3 buckets).
3. In **AWS Config**, set up an **AWS Config rule** that triggers the Lambda function when a non-compliant resource is detected.
4. In **AWS Security Hub**, configure **Automated Response and Remediation** to invoke the Lambda function upon detection of a non-compliant resource.

Hereâ€™s a simple Lambda function to deny public access to an S3 bucket:

```python
import boto3

s3 = boto3.client('s3')

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    bucket_name = event['detail']['requestParameters']['bucketName']
    response = s3.put_bucket_acl(
        Bucket=bucket_name,
        ACL='private'
    )
    return response
