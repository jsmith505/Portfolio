# Custom CloudWatch Metrics and Alerts

## Overview

Amazon CloudWatch provides powerful monitoring capabilities for AWS resources and applications. In this guide, we will explore how to create custom metrics and configure alerts to monitor your applications and infrastructure in AWS.

CloudWatch allows you to create custom metrics to monitor specific aspects of your system, and you can set up alarms to automatically notify you or take actions based on the threshold of those metrics.

## Features

- **Custom Metrics**: Publish custom data to CloudWatch for monitoring specific application or system performance.
- **CloudWatch Alarms**: Set up alerts to notify you when the metrics exceed defined thresholds.
- **Automation**: Integrate with other AWS services (e.g., Lambda, SNS) to trigger actions based on metric thresholds.
- **Scalability**: Monitor large-scale systems with fine-grained custom metrics and alerts.

## Prerequisites

- AWS Account
- IAM permissions to access CloudWatch, CloudWatch Logs, and other AWS services
- AWS CLI installed (or access to the AWS Management Console)
- Your application running on EC2, Lambda, or other resources where custom metrics are needed

## Step 1: Creating Custom CloudWatch Metrics

To create custom CloudWatch metrics, you can publish custom data from your application or infrastructure to CloudWatch using the `PutMetricData` API or through AWS SDKs.

### Example: Publishing Custom Metrics from EC2

You can use the `aws cloudwatch put-metric-data` command to send custom metrics.

For example, to send custom CPU utilization metrics:

```bash
aws cloudwatch put-metric-data --namespace "Custom" --metric-name "CustomCPUUtilization" --value 75 --unit Percent
