# End to End CI/CD Automation using GitHub Actions and AWS CodePipeline

## Overview

CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery) is an essential part of modern DevOps practices that automate the process of building, testing, and deploying applications. In this guide, we'll cover how to set up an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline that integrates **GitHub Actions** with **AWS CodePipeline** for a seamless automated workflow.

This setup enables developers to push code to GitHub, which triggers the pipeline in AWS CodePipeline to build, test, and deploy the application automatically.

## Features

- **GitHub Actions**: Automate build and deployment tasks directly from your GitHub repository.
- **AWS CodePipeline**: Automate end-to-end delivery workflows, from code commit to deployment.
- **Integration**: Sync GitHub with AWS services to create a unified CI/CD process.
- **Scalability**: Easily scale the pipeline as your project grows.
- **Rollback**: Easily roll back to a previous version if necessary.

## Prerequisites

- AWS Account
- GitHub Repository
- IAM permissions for GitHub and AWS to interact with each other
- AWS CLI installed
- Docker (if using containerized apps)
- Node.js, Java, Python, or any other application setup you want to deploy

## Step 1: Set Up GitHub Actions for Build and Test

GitHub Actions provides workflows that can be triggered by events in your repository. In this case, we'll trigger the workflow on a `push` event to the `main` branch.

1. In your GitHub repository, navigate to the **Actions** tab.
2. Create a new workflow by adding a `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` file.

Hereâ€™s an example `ci-cd.yml` file for a Node.js application:

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

      - name: Build the app
        run: npm run build

      - name: Deploy to AWS CodePipeline (trigger)
        run: |
          aws codepipeline start-pipeline-execution --name MyCodePipeline
        env:
          AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          AWS_DEFAULT_REGION: 'us-east-1'
