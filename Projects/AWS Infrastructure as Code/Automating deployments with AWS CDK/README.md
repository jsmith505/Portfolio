# Automating Deployments with AWS CDK

## Overview

This tutorial demonstrates how to automate infrastructure deployments using the **AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)**. AWS CDK allows developers to define cloud infrastructure in programming languages like TypeScript, Python, Java, and C#. By using AWS CDK, you can define cloud resources as code and deploy them easily with the AWS CDK CLI.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to set up and automate deployments for AWS resources like EC2 instances, S3 buckets, Lambda functions, and more using AWS CDK.

## Prerequisites

Before you start this tutorial, ensure you have the following:

- **AWS Account** with the necessary permissions to create and manage resources.
- **AWS CLI** installed and configured. If not, follow the installation guide [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html).
- **AWS CDK** installed. You can follow the installation instructions [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/work-with-cdk.html).
- Basic knowledge of **AWS services** like EC2, S3, Lambda, IAM, and others.
- Familiarity with the **Node.js** environment if using JavaScript or TypeScript.

## Steps

### Step 1: Set Up AWS CDK Project

1. **Initialize a New CDK Project**:
   Run the following command to initialize your CDK project in the desired directory. Choose the programming language (e.g., TypeScript, Python) based on your preference.

   ```bash
   mkdir cdk-deployment
   cd cdk-deployment
   cdk init app --language=typescript
